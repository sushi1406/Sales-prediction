# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning in Python

## Overview

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase. This prediction takes into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Accurate sales predictions enable businesses to make informed decisions about their advertising strategies, optimize costs, and ultimately maximize their sales potential.

In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques in Python to predict future sales based on historical data. The role of a Data Scientist is pivotal in this process, as they analyze and interpret data to extract valuable insights that guide decision-making.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project consists of various features that influence sales, such as:

- **TV**: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
- **Radio**: Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars)
- **Newspaper**: Advertising budget spent on Newspapers (in thousands of dollars)
- **Sales**: Sales of the product (in thousands of units)


## Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration & Visualization
   - Understanding the distribution of data
   - Checking for missing values
   - Visualizing relationships between features and sales

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (if needed)
   - Data normalization or standardization

### 3. Model Selection
   - Choosing appropriate machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

### 4. Model Training
   - Training the selected models on the training data
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

### 5. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluating the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared
   - Comparing the performance of different models

## Model Selection

The following machine learning models are considered for this project:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet powerful regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.




## Results

The results of the model evaluations will be presented in this section, highlighting the model that performed the best in predicting sales.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.
